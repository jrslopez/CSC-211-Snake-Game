# CSC-211-Snake-Game
A snake game project for our CSC 211 Intermediate Programming class in CUNY College of Staten Island

To run the program, MS Visual Studio must be installed or other software that can compile .cpp files.

The game is made with various difficulty levels. You can choose the level you prefer and earn the highest score you can get.

Made with the collaboration of Fabio Pecora, Karen Koag, and Megan Kwan
